Hi there! I'm QuantumPickleJar, a passionate and versatile developer with experience spanning a diverse range of projects and languages. My repositories showcase my enthusiasm for exploring new technologies, solving unique problems, and creating impactful solutions.

### What I Work On
- **Web Development**: From crafting modest static portfolios like [Personal-Static](https://github.com/QuantumPickleJar/Personal-Static) to building interactive JavaScript-based applications like [JsKiosk](https://github.com/QuantumPickleJar/JsKiosk) and [OGS](https://github.com/QuantumPickleJar/OGS).
- **Mobile and Cross-Platform Apps**: Experimenting with frameworks like MAUI ([Exploratory-MAUI-App](https://github.com/QuantumPickleJar/Explatory-MAUI-App)) and Dart for analytics and faculty-student tools ([uwo_athlete_surveyor](https://github.com/QuantumPickleJar/uwo_athlete_surveyor)).
- **Programming Practices**: Enhancing my skills in structured programming and object-oriented design, as seen in projects like [OperaHouse-v3](https://github.com/QuantumPickleJar/OperaHouse-v3) and [PlanetsideApp-master](https://github.com/QuantumPickleJar/PlanetsideApp-master).
- **Secure Media and Data Handling**: Tackling challenges in secure data storage through Python and JavaScript ([secure-media-depot](https://github.com/QuantumPickleJar/secure-media-depot)).

### My Skills
